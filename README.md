### Transpiling ES6 modules with Webpack 

In this post, we have been able to demonstrate how to transpile code written with ES6 import and export syntax via webpack and the webpack-cli package.

To build with webpack we can run ```npm run watch``` locally for development builds. For production builds we can run ```npm run build```.

The input file is located in the `src` directory which contains the entry point for our webpack build. The output files are located in the  `dist` folder.
